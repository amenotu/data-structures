#Data-Structures
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta). This project was worked on with a pair.

This is an exercise on implementing data structures and instantiation patterns in Javascript, which include the following:
• Stack (in functional, functional-shared, prototypal, and pseudo-classical instantiation patterns) \n
• Queue (in functional, functional-shared, prototypal, and pseudo-classical instantiation patterns) \n
• Graph
• Singly Linked List
• Hash Table
• Set
• Tree
• Binary Search Tree

#Requirements
• jQuery
• RequireJS
• Mocha
• Underscore.js
• Chai

#Testing
To run the testing suite, just open the SpecRunner.html file in the browser.
